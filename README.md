# Design Principles
- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
- Program to an interface, not an implementation. (Program to a supertype)
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

# Patterns
* Strategy `npm run strategy`
  * The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
* Observer `npm run observer`
  * The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
