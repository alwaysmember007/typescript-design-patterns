# Design Principles
- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
- Program to an interface, not an implementation. (Program to a supertype)
- Favor composition over inheritance.

# Patterns
## Strategy
- The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
- `npm run strategy`
